# Recall corpus

This corpus protects what CukeDedup finds, not only aggregate finding counts.
Each case in `manifest.json` records one of three outcomes:

- `expectedFindings`: behavior the analyzer supports and must retain;
- `expectedAbsent`: intentional non-findings that protect precision;
- `knownMisses`: desired findings not implemented yet.

When a known miss is fixed, move it to `expectedFindings` and reduce
`knownMissBaseline`. New known misses must not be added to make CI pass.

The fixtures are synthetic and contain no private project data.

The `precision-*` cases exercise assertion provenance through the built CLI:
trusted/unrelated ESM and CJS imports, different external and local values,
inline/local equivalence, nested shadowing, erased/runtime namespaces, decorators,
and genuine duplicates with mixed modules or renamed local variables. Exact
finding expectations reject unexpected errors and warnings; positive controls
prevent an analyzer that suppresses all handler findings from passing. Uncertain
external values must not establish handler equivalence. Inline/local equivalence
is a required detection contract, including when the value is held in a local constant.
