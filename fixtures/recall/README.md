# Recall corpus

The `review-gap-*` cases cover the five remaining review groups: namespace-alias
mutation, equivalent assertion syntax (named-default imports and wrapped callees),
lexical TDZ shadowing, nested asymmetric matchers, and candidate filtering.
Each run selects one input shape from `review-gaps/` with `--definitions` so
unrelated cases cannot contaminate its findings. The candidate checks require one
useful comparison and retain a true finding under a one-candidate limit; they do
not claim to reproduce starvation at default limits. Positive controls complement
explicit non-findings. These are required contracts, not newly accepted known misses.

Computed-key cases distinguish static factory trust from dynamic keys and possible alias mutations.
The mutation case runs separately so it cannot invalidate the positive control's namespace.
The deferred-assertion case retains matching callbacks while rejecting conflicting values,
negation, and unresolved inline calls. Exact total finding counts also reject unlisted pairings.

This corpus protects what CukeDedup finds, not only aggregate finding counts.
Each case in `manifest.json` records one of three outcomes:

- `expectedFindings`: behavior the analyzer supports and must retain;
- `expectedAbsent`: intentional non-findings that protect precision;
- `knownMisses`: desired findings not implemented yet.

When a known miss is fixed, move it to `expectedFindings` and reduce
`knownMissBaseline`. New known misses must not be added to make CI pass.

The fixtures are synthetic and contain no private project data.

The `precision-*` cases exercise assertion provenance through the built CLI:
trusted/unrelated ESM and CJS imports, different external and local values,
inline/local equivalence, nested shadowing, erased/runtime namespaces, decorators,
and genuine duplicates with mixed modules or renamed local variables. Exact
finding expectations reject unexpected errors and warnings; positive controls
prevent an analyzer that suppresses all handler findings from passing. Uncertain
external values must not establish handler equivalence. Inline/local equivalence
is a required detection contract, including when the value is held in a local constant.
