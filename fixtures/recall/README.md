# Recall corpus

This corpus protects what CukeDedup finds, not only aggregate finding counts.
Each case in `manifest.json` records one of three outcomes:

- `expectedFindings`: behavior the analyzer supports and must retain;
- `expectedAbsent`: intentional non-findings that protect precision;
- `knownMisses`: desired findings not implemented yet.

When a known miss is fixed, move it to `expectedFindings` and reduce
`knownMissBaseline`. New known misses must not be added to make CI pass.

The fixtures are synthetic and contain no private project data.
